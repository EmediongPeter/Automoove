# A React + Typescript Image Slider

This is one of my first projects in react - An Image Slider that has functionalities suitable for effective user experience including Screen Readers

Currently, the project is live via this link: [The Ultimate Beginner Image Slider](https://imageslider.vercel.app)

## Expanding more on How I built the project

I developed this application with the help of Kyle, the founder of [Web Dev Simplified](https://youtube.com/webdevsimplified). But as we devs all know, just watching tutorials, copying and pasting the codes without proper understanding of the concepts behind these things isn't the right way to learn.

So after proper understanding of the concepts Kyle used, I decided to add a few  features to the project that will be intriguing, maybe solve a problem for someone, and I must say <b>I really learnt a lot by putting that extra 1% effort, if not I'll still be stuck in the tutorial hell</b>

So below are the features I implemented:

- Added an infinite loop for the images to slide on their own
- Turned the site to not just an image slider but to a site where you can explore the different brands of cars and SUVs one would love
- Configured the platform to a site where you can upload the cars you would love to buy (of course, even though we have to work, it is our desire to have these fancy things and experience comfort and luxury)
- Added an authentication system such that a user can have his or her own information, stored for his own use
- I did a kind of Auto Trader kind of stuff. You just check the site you will get to know what I mean.

Bye for now, keep smiling, keep working and be the change you want to see in your world.

<b>For the love Tech</b>
